Getting Started with Elm
==============================

This repo contains the code that I used when going through the video "Getting Started with Elm" from
Pluralsight.  

It is a great introductory video and one that I encourage others to watch, even if you are not planning
to do any elm code, it is worth understanding some of the concepts and reasons behind the language.
